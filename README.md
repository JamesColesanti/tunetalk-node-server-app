# TuneTalk
This repository is in charge of the back-end operations of the TuneTalk web application.\
Frontend repository: https://github.com/JamesColesanti/tunetalk-react-web-app

### Running the frontend

In the root directory, run `npm start` (you'll need to run `npm install` the very first time). After several moments (or minutes, depending on the speed of your machine), a browser will open with the backend running locally.
